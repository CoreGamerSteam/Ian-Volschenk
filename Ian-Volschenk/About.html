        <center><p style="color: rgb(226, 226, 226);">I first started taking intrested in game designing when i played this online platform back in 2018 called Roblox and it had this extra application called Roblox Studio and when i first tried and i was quite ill prepared and unknowing what i was doing i just place a block and a block and a few already created items and so on and i wasn't quite happy with what i made so i stoped for a while and after a year or two i came back and started to get more use to it and hense got atatched to the building side of game development and aswell as a tiny little but scripting.</p></center>
        <br>
        <center><p style="color: rgb(226, 226, 226);">It was hard to do it without a scripter and i mainly created games involving building and not scripting which was not good of course considering most games can't be good without a little bit of scripting so after words i found out this coding class was being held in my school so i attended it and was curious and exited sense i feel like this could develop my own scripting skills more and i was right.</p></center>
